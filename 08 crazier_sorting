Meatier, juicier algorithms (Colt Steele)

__00_Introduction__

quadratic sorts are slower than nlogn sorts. quads do not square well.

__01_Merge_Sort__

von Neumann invented this (so far as we know).

Merging is a divide-and-conquer approach.

the 'merge' aspect is the combination of two previously-sorted arrays.

Observe that an array with length less than 1 is already sorted.

please see colt_merge.js

nLogn time!


__02_Quick_Sort__

also a recursive sort

select a pivot point (any element) and move stuff around relative to the pivot
(lesser elements to left, greater elements to right)

this is extremely tricky.
write your own implementation 3x or 4x.
