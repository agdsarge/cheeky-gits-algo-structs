Data Structures!

__00_Introduction__

data structures are: 
    collections of values,
    the relationships among the values, and 
    the operations that can be applied to the data

some structures are specialized
others (like arrays) are more generally used.

the more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use another data structure

the DOM, for instance, is a Tree

and, hey, a lot of data structures are in interviews.

__01_Singly_Linked_List__

A linked list is a data structure that is ordered. 
It has
    a head, 
    a tail, and 
    a length.

Each node has 
    a value and 
    a pointer to another node or to null

Linked lists are not indexed, thus traversal to node X takes X time. Random access is not possible.

But, insertion and deletion are easy!

class Node {
    constructor (val) {
        this.val = val
        this.next = null
    }
}

class SinglyLinkedList() {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null
        this.tail = null
        this.length = 0
    }
    
    push = (val) => {
        let newNode = new Node(val)
        if (!this.head) {
            this.head = newNode
            this.tail = newNode
        } else {
            this.tail.next = newNode
            this.tail = newNode
        }
        this.length++
    }

    pop = () => {
        
    }

    shift = () => {
        if (this.length === 0) return undefined
        let oldHead = this.head
        if (this.length === 1) {
            this.head = null
            this.tail = null
            
        }


        this.length--
        return oldHead
    }
} 


let first = new Node(1)
first.next = new Node(2)
first.next.next = new Node(3)

// (Zizek voice) and so on.
