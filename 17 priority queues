Priority Queues

Binary heaps are used to build priority queues.

A PQ is a data strucuture in which every element has a priority. 
Elements with higher priorities are served beofre elements with lower priorities.

(E.g. a gunshot wound in the ER has a higher priority than a nasty papercut.)

Priority queues are a separate concept.
You can build them with other data structures.
We will use heaps because it's efficient.

For our purposes, a lower score is a higher priority.
Thus, in effect, we have a min binary heap.


class Node {
    constructor(val, priority) {
        this.val = val
        this.priority  = priority
    }
}

class PriorityQueue {
    constructor() {
        values = []
    }

    

}
